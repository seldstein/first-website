                </h2>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"><em>Cutter’s Way</em> is a story about
                    stories. Its heroes are drunks, cripples (physical and otherwise), narcissists, and nymphomaniacs;
                    AKA average people. People being people — and these people are no exception — when they encounter
                    things they don’t understand, like a murdered rape victim in a trashcan, for example, they have two
                    choices: try to explain what they see, or don’t. The latter is easier; all it requires is a
                    blinkering of the proverbial vision (an endeavor best facilitated by a little heavy drinking) though
                    it has its own mortal consequences, as Mo’s tragic arc shows us. The former is more difficult,
                    though mechanically it’s simple: a mere opening of the eyes, the willful act of looking. Better yet,
                    seeing. You don’t turn away, you look, you see the corpse in the trashcan. It’s a more virtuous
                    response — certainly acknowledging the world’s suffering, even if you don’t feel like you can
                    personally do anything about it, is better than pretending it isn’t happening — but it’s not without
                    its peculiar dangers. You may open your eyes so wide you start to see things that aren’t there.
                    That’s Cutter’s way.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Odin gave an eye for wisdom. Cutter gave
                    an eye, an arm, a leg, and possibly his sexual viability (certainly his virility) for what? He’d
                    like to know that too. He went to war and he came back with PTSD manifest as extreme paranoia and a
                    propensity for conspiracy. That’s not why he went to fight. It’s not like he signed on hoping he
                    would get those things. Still, that’s what he got. How does he deal with that? By making it mean
                    something. Only he has no idea how to do that. That is, until Bone points at Cord astride his white
                    horse and says, That’s him. That’s the murderer.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">And that’s another thing to remember, is
                    that Bone is the one who started all this, not Cutter. Cutter just latches onto the idea, and more
                    ferociously than Bone must have imagined he would. Bone regrets the accusation almost immediately
                    after he makes it, and so begins this flip-flop teeter-totter cycle where Cutter will go away and do
                    some detective work and come back and say to Bone, Here’s what I’ve got, and Bone will appear to be
                    convinced. Being convinced, he’ll go along with Cutter, for a while. Until things start to get too
                    real. Then he backs out, and he does it every time. Why? Does he really not believe that Cord is the
                    murderer? It seems unlikely. If he believed that with any conviction there’s no way Cutter with all
                    his antics could persuade him otherwise.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">The other possibility is that Bone does
                    believe Cord is the killer but he’s afraid of what that means. Moreover, he’s afraid of the
                    responsibility that foists on his shoulders as a murder witness. If Cord is innocent, Bone doesn’t
                    have to do anything, he can move on with his life. But if Cord is guilty, now Bone has to make a
                    decision. And if there’s one thing Bone hates it’s making decisions. He’s a bachelor/drifter. He
                    couldn’t make a decision, much less an ethically-weighted one, if his life depended on it. And
                    funnily — maybe ironically — enough, that’s exactly the position he finds himself in. Because if he
                    chooses to keep his eyes closed, if he remains willfully blind, that has its own consequences. It
                    means he’ll have to suffer the repercussions of his inaction, i.e. he’ll have to live with himself
                    for the rest of his life. It’s a choice that maybe he wishes he was brave enough to make, but he
                    spends the entire movie avoiding it. It’s only when Cutter’s lying dead on the floor that Bone
                    finally comes to a real and fatal conclusion.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">“It was you,” Bone says. Cord asks in
                    reply, “What if it were?” The answer to that is everything. People are dead. People he loves are
                    dead. If it wasn’t Cord, their deaths mean nothing. So Cord has to be guilty. It’s that, or nothing
                    means anything.</p>
