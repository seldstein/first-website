        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Sam Feldstein.</strong> I write fantasy and science fiction short stories, and the occasional
            essay. I've been doing so for about nine years now (I'm counting from college, when I began to take writing
            "seriously," but I've more or less been writing stories for as long as I can remember) though I've only
            recently begun to publish. Probably that's because it's only recently that I've written anything I consider
            worth publishing. You can find a list of said publications below.</p>

        <p>For now, this website doesn't amount to much more than a portfolio. I hope to expand it, slowly but surely,
            to include a Writer Resources page, a Methodology page, and an About page, among other things. Beyond that,
            what I'd like it to be, I think, is a persona. If I add to it consistently enough for long enough,
            eventually it will become the digital analogue to my brain. But everything in time.</p>

        <p>If you'd like updates about my work, the best way to get them is to subscribe to my <a
                href="https://samfeldstein.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a> newsletter (it's free). You can
            also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/samfeldstein" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, though I don't use
            it much, and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/" target="_blank">Letterboxd</a>. If you'd like
            to get in touch, you can email me at <a href="mailto:samfeldstein@proton.me"
